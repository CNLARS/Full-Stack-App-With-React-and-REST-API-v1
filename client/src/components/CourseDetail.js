/* "Course Detail":
 
By retrieving the detail for a course from the REST API's
 /api/courses/:id route and rendering the page.
  +"Delete Course" button, when clicked sends a DELETE request to 
    the /api/courses/:id route.
   +"Update Course" button

    ! Use the <ReactMarkdown> component to render course description
     and materialsNeeded properties as markdown formatted text.
     
On the "Course Detail", add rendering logic so the
 "Update Course" and "Delete Course" buttons only display if:
   There's an authenticated user.
   AND the user's ID matches that of the user who owns the course.

Use the <ReactMarkdown> component to render the
 course description and materialsNeeded properties
  as markdown formatted text.
